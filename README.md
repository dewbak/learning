# Learning repo

This repo is for storing progress in the learning process with cources, tutorials etc.

## WOW
The recommended way of working should be to create a new branch for every new tutorial or cource started.
Create a seperate commit for every new chapter or part on that branch to be able to track progress and to be able to go back in history and recreate scenarios.
